      <div><p>Bon Entendeur, c’est avant tout un trio d’amis fédérés par une même passion de la musique et de son esthétique, et qui utilise celle-ci pour sublimer la culture française et les personnalités qui l’incarnent.<br />
Le concept est simple : une personnalité, un thème, une heure de découvertes musicales.</p>
<p>« Bon Entendeur c’est un trio qui écoute. Qui tend l’oreille. Qui habille le propos pour le rendre plus juste, plus fort, plus intéressant […] Pour danser intelligent. »<br />
France Inter, 13.01.17</p>
<p>Chaque mixtape, représentant des heures de recherche et de mixage, propose mensuellement une nouvelle sélection de trouvailles musicales globalement électroniques mais teintées de funk, disco, hip-hop&#8230; Le but ? Habiller les propos de figures de la culture francophone, propos qu’ils tendent de plus en plus à recueillir eux-mêmes, comme c’est le cas pour PPDA, Oxmo Puccino ou encore Richard Bohringer.</p>
<p>Pas moins de 25 millions d’écoutes dans le monde entier témoignent du succès de ce concept. Au départ simple créateurs de playlists puis de mixtapes, le trio est vite passé derrière les platines pour répondre aux sollicitations. Aujourd’hui, entre mixtapes, DJ Sets et organisation d’événements, l’actualité de Bon Entendeur les projette aux 1ers plans de la musique électronique française.</p>
